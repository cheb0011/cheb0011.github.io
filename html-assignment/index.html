            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is <em>Soufiane</em>, and I'm from Algeria. I came to Canada in August 1<sup>st</sup>, 2024. At first, I settled in the city of Montreal for a year and half with the goal of studying at the Universite de Montreal <abbr title="universite de Montrael">UdeM</abbr>. however, I didn't like the academic system there, so I decided to look for another program. Eventually, I chose to enroll at <em>Algonquin college,</em> after a friend suggested it to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm currently studying the <em>Interactive Media Design</em> program at <abbr title="College Algonquin" >AC</abbr>. This program caught my attention because it encouurages creativity and personal development . It also allows me to interact with innovate and creative people, from whom I can learn and grow. during my studies, I aspire to acquire many  skills so that  I can become capable of innovation and creative expression.
